                which helps me to name CSS classes. At the same time it helps me with writing clean and transparent HTML markup. 
                Also, I used the CSS <strong>Flexbox</strong> Layout Module, which makes it easier to design a flexible responsive layout structure 
                without using float or positioning. Also its Browser Support is really good.</p></div>

                I opted for pure native JavaScript and an object-oriented way of codding. 
                In addition to much faster loading and execution modern JavaScript has excellent browser support.
                To write highly organized JavaScript I usually structure my code in a few steps:
                <strong>1.Selecting elements from the DOM</strong> <strong>2.Event handling</strong> <strong>3.Defining functionality</strong>.
                This type of organization I applied to a few features (mobile menu, sticky header, revealing boxes on a scroll, modal window)

                Automation is when we force a computer to execute some task for us. 
                The organization is clearly written code (many separate files which are related to a certain part of a website ) 
                and just one bundled file (css & js) which browser will load quickly to satisfied high performances. 
                To accomplish all of that here I decide to use Webpack, which is really great tool.
